Between shots a manned mortar has a cooldown-time that only ticks down when a shooter is still manning it.
This mod adds a job similar to the turret rearming-job but for readying mannable mortar-like turrets.
Pawns will reload and ready mortars as a job under hauling. 

This means that hopefully your mortars are all ready to fire when you next need them.
It also means that pawns incapabable of violence can help out readying, the same way they can replace barrels.

Ive tried it with various mortar-mods but if you notice any issues please report what mod that adds it and I will try to add compatibility for it.
